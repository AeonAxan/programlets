Some small utility scripts and programs I have done here and there.

- **hibernateTimer.py** : python script which will hibernate windows after a given number of minutes.
- **bench.c** : Benchmarks harvard's CS50/pset5/speller program. Works on the CS50 appliance only.
- **christ.php** : Webscraper which scrapes attendence from Christ University Student Login and returns JSON
