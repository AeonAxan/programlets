Some small utility scripts and programs I have done here and there.

###Caesar

Decrypt's a string of text encrypted with [Caesar's cypher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). The program can
decrypt it even if the Cipher text is not space seperated. In this case it will output all possibilities. Note: Only words
present in the dictionary(words) will be considered as valid words.

###Bench

Benchmarks harvard's [CS50](https://www.cs50.net/)/pset5/speller program. Works on the CS50 appliance only.
The benchmark of your program is run against the Staff's implementation and a nice comparision table is printed
